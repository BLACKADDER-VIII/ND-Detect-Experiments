chain_matching.ipynb: This file implements the Meta Process-Graph heuristic. Update the graph file I/O in block 3. Use the hyperparameter settings in Block 5.
For message race and amg2013: rev=False, norm_sens_high = False, lcs = False, num_proc = # of processes in the event graph
For MCB Grid: rev = True, norm_sens_high = True, lcs = True, num_proc = # of processes in the event graph

GAE_updt.ipynb implements the graph auto-encoder benchmark. Set the graph I/O in block 2 and the hyperparameters for number of processes (NUM_PROCS), number of training epochs (NUM_EPOCHS) and number of experiments (NUM_EXPS).
